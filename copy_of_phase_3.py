"""# Final Conclusion and Summary of the Analysis

# The analysis performed sentiment analysis on a dataset of text data, aiming to classify the sentiment expressed in each text as positive, negative, or neutral.  Several steps were performed including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

# Key Findings:

# 1. Data Preprocessing:  Missing values in the 'label' column were filled using the mean. Duplicate rows were removed.
# 2. Feature Engineering: TF-IDF vectorization was applied to convert the text data into numerical features that machine learning algorithms can understand. Sentiment scores were calculated using VADER sentiment analyzer and used as additional features.
# 3. Model Training and Evaluation:  Multiple models were used for classification: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), KMeans clustering and Gradient Boosting Classifier.  The Gradient Boosting Classifier model produced the highest accuracy.
# 4. Model Evaluation: Metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and the confusion matrix were used to evaluate the performance of the models. The Gradient Boosting Classifier demonstrated superior performance.
# 5. Feature Importance Analysis: Feature importance analysis was performed to understand which words contribute the most to the sentiment prediction, visualized using a horizontal bar chart.

# 6. Visualization: Countplots, boxplots, and confusion matrix visualizations were created to visually represent the label distribution, relationship between sentiment score and label, and the model's performance.

# 7. Key Performance Indicator: The best model achieved the highest accuracy which is indicated in the output.

# 8. Limitations: The choice of models used were limited. Further analysis can be done with multiple models to improve the accuracy.

# 9. Recommendations: Additional feature engineering techniques can further enhance model accuracy.

# Overall: The models are able to predict the sentiment of text data accurately, with the Gradient Boosting classifier outperforming the other models. The feature importance analysis provides valuable insight into the underlying factors driving sentiment predictions.
